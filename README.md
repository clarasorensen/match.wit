## match.wit now WitCon!

WitCon (Women in Tech Connect) is a web application made to pair women in tech with other women in tech. Its sophisticated use of machine learning algorithms to match mentors and mentees makes it an ideal match up for women all over the world. Additionally, WitCon acts as a resource center for women in the field and those aspiring to get their foot in the door. It hosts a selection of articles handpicked by our admins (who are women in tech themselves) in addition to select coding tutorials, hackathon suggestions, and more.

### The creators
WitCon was created during Whack Spring 2017 by 5 Wellesley College students: Alison Savage ('17), Hye Sun Yun ('17), Jess Cherayil ('18), Clara Sorensen ('18), and Karina Lin ('19). As women looking to pursue careers in the tech industry, they decided that a global mentor/mentee application would be ideal to help women break the glass ceiling.

### The Matching Process
Taking into account the types of relationships both mentors and mentees wish to have, our algorithm matches people following a user's completition of signing up for the site. It attempts to pair people in similar location (it's a global resource), of similar dialects, and of matching backgrounds and interests.
